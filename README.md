# MCP Agent Framework 🤖

A Python framework for building LLM agents that can interact with local & remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## What is this? 🤔

This project lets you:
- 🔌 Connect to MCP servers (local and remote)
- 🛠️ Manage tools from multiple apps
- 🤖 Build LLM agents that can use those tools
- 🔄 Switch between different LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)


## Future Goals 🚀
- Allow LLM to write to its own memory to improve workflow accuracy
- Human in the loop feedback mode
- UI similar to n8n for automating workflows
